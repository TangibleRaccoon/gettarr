Gettarr is a self-hosted, open-source media downloader that provides a configurable, ad-free way to download and manage media content. With Gettarr, you can download your favorite media files and share them directly, ensuring that the content remains accessible even if itâ€™s later removed, moved, or updated on social media platforms.

## Overview

The primary goal of Gettarr is to simplify media consumption:
- **Media Ownership:** Download your favorite media files directly instead of depending on external platforms.
- **Easy Sharing:** Share files with friends without requiring them to access social media.
- **Content Preservation:** Keep a personal archive of the media content you love.

Gettarr wraps around [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) , supporting downloads from a wide range of websites.
